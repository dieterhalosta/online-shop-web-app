# Inspiration
This is the front end application for the Online Shop app, developed during the Java Bootcamp. 
The back end was developed separately (https://github.com/dieterhalosta/online-shop) using Java, Spring Boot and MySQL.
For the front end side I used a Bootstrap template and jQuery to connect with the back end.

# Development stack
+ [JavaScript]
+ [Bootstrap] for the features and easy to use templates.
+ [Ustora UI] as a templates.
+ I used [jQuery] to connect with the back end.
+ I used git for version control, and stored progress on GitHub.
+ Currently only tested on an Windows enviorment.
